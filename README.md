Micro Blog

This is my first project using html, css, boostrap, jQuery and javascript. The Blog I create is more similar to a todo apps. Part of the reason I want to create the app like a todo is because, as a tralveing advisor I often have to give planning advice to friends and customers where they should visit in a week's planning. Having a customer todo app really help me give better instructions to my friends and clients. 

This app I first want to have a title and body which I can record dates on the title and objective. And the body is the detail of the date's plan. In the future, I want to add link is clickable and able to link to google map and other feature.

There are couple features I want to add on to this apps but not able to complete before the due days. One of the features is to remove the post by clicking the glyphicon trash can. I was unable to target the element. Another place I want to improve my app in the future is add comment section, tracking post number and add "up vote" feature. And will add a new section for popular post.
